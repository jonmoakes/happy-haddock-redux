      please note that this app is a demonstration app.
    </p>
    <p>in a real app, this form would obviously email your business.</p>
    <p>
      in this demo app though, the form will message me should you wish to
      enquire about having your very own app for your business.
    </p>

    <p>
      it could be a close copy of this one or totally custom designed for
      yourself and tailored to whatever business you have that sells products
      online.
