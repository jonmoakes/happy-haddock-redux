      <h2>3. Definition of data</h2>
      <p>Protection terms</p>
      <p>
        3.1: Data is information which is stored electronically, on a computer,
        or in certain paper-based filing systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.2: Data subjects for the purpose of this policy include all living
        individuals about whom we hold personal data. A data subject need not be
        a UK national or resident. All data subjects have legal rights in
        relation to their personal data.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.3 Personal data means data relating to a living individual who can be
        identified from that data (or from that data and other information in
        our possession). Personal data can be factual (such as a name, address
        or date of birth) or it can be an opinion (such as a performance
        appraisal).
      </p>
      <p>
        3.4: Data controllers are the people who or organisations which
        determine the purposes for which, and the manner in which, any personal
        data is processed. They have a responsibility to establish practices and
        policies in line with the Act. We are the data controller of all
        personal data used in our business.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.5: Data users have a duty to protect the information they handle by
        following our data protection and security policies at all times.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.6: Data processors include any person who processes personal data on
        behalf of a data controller. This could include suppliers which handle
        personal data on our behalf.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.7: Processing is any activity that involves use of the data. It
        includes obtaining, recording or holding the data, or carrying out any
        operation or set of operations on the data including organising,
        amending, retrieving, using, disclosing, erasing or destroying it.
        Processing also includes transferring personal data to third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.8: Sensitive personal data includes information about a person's
        racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or similar
        beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health or condition
        or sexual life, or about the commission of, or proceedings for, any
        offence committed or alleged to have been committed by that person, the
        disposal of such proceedings or the sentence of any court in such
        proceedings. Sensitive personal data can only be processed under strict
        conditions, and will usually require the express consent of the person
        concerned.
      </p>
      <h2>4: Data protection principles</h2>
      <p>
        4.1: Anyone processing personal data must comply with the eight
        enforceable principles of good practice. These provide that personal
        data must be: (a) Processed fairly and lawfully. (b) Processed for
        limited purposes and in an appropriate way. (c) Adequate, relevant and
        not excessive for the purpose. (d) Accurate. (e) Not kept longer than
        necessary for the purpose. (f) Processed in line with data subjects'
        rights. (g) Secure. (h) Not transferred to people or organisations
        situated in countries without adequate protection.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>5: Fair and lawful processing</h2>
      <p>
        5.1: The Act is intended not to prevent the processing of personal data,
        but to ensure that it is done fairly and without adversely affecting the
        rights of the data subject. The data subject must be told who the data
        controller is (in this case Jonathan Oakes ), who the data 3
        controller's representative is (in this case Jonathan Oakes ), the
        purpose for which the data is to be processed by us, and the identities
        of anyone to whom the data may be disclosed or transferred.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.2: For personal data to be processed lawfully, certain conditions have
        to be met. These may include, among other things, requirements that the
        data subject has consented to the processing, or that the processing is
        necessary for the legitimate interest of the data controller or the
        party to whom the data is disclosed. When sensitive personal data is
        being processed, more than one condition must be met. In most cases the
        data subject's explicit consent to the processing of such data will be
        required.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.3: Processing for limited purposes Personal data may only be processed
        for the specific purposes notified to the data subject when the data was
        first collected or for any other purposes specifically permitted by the
        Act. This means that personal data must not be collected for one purpose
        and then used for another. If it becomes necessary to change the purpose
        for which the data is processed, the data subject must be informed of
        the new purpose before any processing occurs.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.4: Adequate, relevant and non-excessive processing Personal data
        should only be collected to the extent that it is required for the
        specific purpose notified to the data subject. Any data which is not
        necessary for that purpose should not be collected in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.5: Accurate data - Personal data must be accurate and kept up to date.
        Information which is incorrect or misleading is not accurate and steps
        should therefore be taken to check the accuracy of any personal data at
        the point of collection and at regular intervals afterwards. Inaccurate
        or out-of-date data should be destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.6: Timely processing Personal data should not be kept longer than is
        necessary for the purpose. This means that data should be destroyed or
        erased from our systems when it is no longer required.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.7: Processing in line with data subject's rights Data must be
        processed in line with data subjects' rights. Data subjects have a right
        to: (a) Request access to any data held about them by a data controller.
        (b) Prevent the processing of their data for direct-marketing purposes.
        (c) Ask to have inaccurate data amended. (d) Prevent processing that is
        likely to cause damage or distress to themselves or anyone else.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>6: Data security</h2>
      <p>
        6.1: We must ensure that appropriate security measures are taken against
        unlawful or unauthorised processing of personal data, and against the
        accidental loss of, or damage to, personal data. Data subjects may apply
        to the courts for compensation if they have suffered damage from such a
        loss.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.2: The Act requires us to put in place procedures and technologies to
        maintain the security of all personal data from the point of collection
        to the point of destruction. Personal data may only be transferred to a
        third-party data processor if he agrees to comply with those procedures
        and policies, or if he puts in place adequate measures himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.3: Maintaining data security means guaranteeing the
        confidentiality,integrity and availability of the personal data, defined
        as follows: (a) Confidentiality means that only people who are
        authorised to use the data can access it. (b) Integrity means that
        personal data should be accurate and suitable for the purpose for which
        it is processed. (c) Availability means that authorised users should be
        able to access the data if they need it for authorised purposes.
        Personal data should therefore be stored on our central computer system
        instead of individual PCs.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.4: Security procedures include: (a) Entry controls. Any stranger seen
        in entry-controlled areas should be reported. (b) Secure lockable desks
        and cupboards. Desks and cupboards should be kept locked if they hold
        confidential information of any kind. (Personal information is always
        considered confidential.) (c) Methods of disposal. Paper documents
        should be shredded. (d) Equipment. Data users should ensure that
        individual monitors do not show confidential information to passers-by
        and that they log off from their PC when it is left unattended.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.5: Dealing with subject access requests. A formal request from a data
        subject for information that we hold about them must be made in writing.
        A fee is payable by the data subject for provision of this information.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.6: Providing information over the telephone. Dealing with telephone
        enquiries should be careful about disclosing any personal information
        held by us. In particular they should: 5 (a) Check the caller's identity
        to make sure that information is only given to a person who is entitled
        to it. (b) Suggest that the caller put their request in writing if they
        are not sure about the caller's identity and where their identity cannot
        be checked. No-one should be bullied into disclosing personal
        information.
